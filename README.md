**Challenge**

1. Go back to Project8 and make the letter group buttons fade out when they are tapped. We were using the `isHidden` property, but you'll need to switch to alpha because `isHidden` is either `true` or `false`, it has no animatable values between.

2. Go back to Project13 and make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first.

3. Go back to Project2 and make the flags scale down with a little bounce when pressed.
